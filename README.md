### Overview

This is our final project for the Vanderbilt University Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  In this endeavor we sought to create a user-friendly application for beer aficionados to discover, save and map routes to breweries all over the US.  Users must first register for an account or log in to an existing account.  From there they have the ability to search for breweries by city or state, view their info, display them on a map and save for later.
